# Wasm?

### Embracing performance
Wasm is a binary instruction format that serves as a portable compilation target for high-level programming languages.

- 🚀 **Near-native speed** - binary instruction format that serves as a portable compilation target
- 📦 **Sandboxed** - embedded in the browser with support in all major ones
- 🧑‍💻 **Language agnostic** - code in languages such as C/C++, Rust, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go
- 🪅 **Integrated with JS** - interoperable with our fav language
- 🤹 **Ecosystem** - various tools and frameworks support
- 🔑 **Security** - by design
- 🌐 **Open standard** - W3C leads the development

<!-- NOT a programming language, but a binary target to which other languages can be compiled to -->
<!-- Stress here how WebAssembly is much closer to binary executable, thus requires less runtime performance optimization -->
<!-- supports parallel execution -->
<!-- super lightweight -->
<!-- is not strictly assembly code, because it was designed to get delivered to the browser which in turn has the capacity to JIT compile to the native underlying architecture native code -->
