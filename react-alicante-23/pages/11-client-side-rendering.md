<h3>Client side rendering with SPAs</h3>
&nbsp;
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>You dont have to go back to the server for more request, page does not refresh. You are fed your üçù javscript right in the browser on first load and manage application lifetime from there.</li>
	<li>Can cache core html/js bundles in a CDN</li>
	<li>Reduced Server Load: Offloads the rendering process to the client, decreasing server resource consumption.</li>
	<li>Naturally much more interactive experience</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>how our app renders on a low end device from a user doing a bus commute to work</li>
	<li>SEO gone to trash</li>
	<li>Unfriendly towards users with JS disabled</li>
</ul>
